ðŸ¤– Classification of data grasped from a physical robotic glove.

Project's specifics:

- ROS interface of a sensorized data glove (VMG30).
- Machine Learning model for shape estimation. Build a network that starting from sensors data estimates either the grasping strategy or the shape of the grasped object
- The model will be generated using real data.
