ðŸ¤– Classification of data grasped from a physical robotic glove.

Project's specifics:

- ROS interface of a sensorized data glove ([VMG30](https://www.vrealities.com/products/data-gloves/vmg30)).
- Testing original spiking/couples oscillators hybrid archetypes I developed for the [EMERGE](https://eic-emerge.eu/) project for shape estimation and event-based online classification.
- Starting from sensors data, the networks estimate shape and stiffness of the grasped object. The model is also generated using real data.
